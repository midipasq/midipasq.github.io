<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> Colloquia and such </b>
<br> Here are slides for several colloquia that I have given on my research in algebraic splines.  Most of these have a significant amount of overlap, but not all.
<ul>
<li> <a href="Colloquia/TowsonColloquium.pdf"> Towson University </a> (Towson MD, November 2016)
<li> <a href="Colloquia/TwoTalesFreeness.pdf"> US Naval Academy </a> (Annapolis MD, November 2016)

</ul>
Here are slides for talks I have given on splines geared toward undergraduates.  Again, there is a good amount of overlap between the presentations.
