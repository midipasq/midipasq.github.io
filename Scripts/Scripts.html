<li><a href="M2Computations.txt"> M2Computations </a> - A script for verifying Proposition 2.7 in "Associated Primes of Spline Complexes" (arXiv:1410.6894) for the polytopal complex in 
Example 2.8.
<li><a href="ShellNonFree"> ShellNonFree </a> - A script for computing 
the module of piecewise continuous polynomial functions on the cone over 
two embeddings of a shellable polytopal complex in the plane.  One of these has the structure of a free module over the polynomial ring in three variables while the other does not.
<li><a href="AlgebraicSplines.m2"> AlgebraicSplines.m2 </a> - Source code for a package for working with algebraic splines on polyhedral complexes. Joint with Gwyneth Whieldon, Eliana Duarte, and Daniel Bernstein.
