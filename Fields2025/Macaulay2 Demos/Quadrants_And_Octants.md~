# First examples: Splines on quadrants and octants
## Setup: Loading the package and generalizedSplines function

First we will need to load the AlgebraicSplines package.

```
loadPackage('AlgebraicSplines')
```

The basic function we will use is generalizedSplines.

```
help generalizedSplines
```
