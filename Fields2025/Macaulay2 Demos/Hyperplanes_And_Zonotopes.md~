# Hyperplanes and Zonotopes
## Loading packages

For this tutorial we'll need to load the Hyperplane Arrangements package.

```
loadPackage("HyperplaneArrangements",Reload=>true);
```

This also loads the package "Polyhedra", which we will also need.

## Hyperplane arrangements

A hyperplane arrangement $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a union
\[
A=\bigcup_{i=1}^k H_i
\]
where $H_1,\ldots,H_k$ are hyperplanes -- i.e. $H_1,\ldots,H_k$ are each the zero locus of a linear form $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$.
