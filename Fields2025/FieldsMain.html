<b><font size="3"> How to run .md files in the Macaulay2 web interface </b>
<ol>
  <li> Download the .md file to your computer (make sure to save it with the .md file extension)
  <li> Open the Macaulay2 web interface at <a href="https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au/"> this link </a>.
  <li> In the left-hand panel, scroll down and click on the "Load your own tutorial" tab.
  <li> When prompted, upload the .md file that you just downloaded.
  <li> You should now see the uploaded file appear as a new tab on the left hand side.
