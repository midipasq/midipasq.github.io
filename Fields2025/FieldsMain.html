<b><font size="3"> Macaulay2 scripts </b>
<br>
Each of the following scripts is a tutorial that can be uploaded to the Macaulay2 web interface.  To run the following files as intended, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li> Download the .txt file to your computer, but switch the .txt extension to .md (for instance, save "Quadrants_And_Octants.txt" as "Quadrants_And_Octants.md")
  <li> Open the Macaulay2 web interface at <a href="https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au/"> this link </a>.
  <li> In the left-hand panel, scroll down and click on the "Load your own tutorial" tab.
  <li> When prompted, upload the .md file that you just downloaded.
  <li> You should now see the uploaded file appear as a new tab on the left hand side.
</ol>
