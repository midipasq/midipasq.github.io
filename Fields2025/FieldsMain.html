<b><font size="3"> Working notes </b>
<br>
Below you will find some preliminary notes on some of the topics that are either directly related to the working group, or are tangentially relevant.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="Working notes/Fields2025-RestrictionAndHyperplaneArrangements.pdf"> A restriction map and applications to freeness, with emphasis on hyperplane arrangements </a>.  This writeup has a rough draft of the restriction map, as well as proposed problems.
  <li> <a href="Working notes/Fields2025-HomologySupportHyperplaneArrangements.pdf"> Notes on presenting the non-trivial homology module for splines on fans in three dimensions </a>.  This writeup is technical.  The main point is to prove that the module of continuous splines on the chambers of a three-dimensional central hyperplane arrangement is free if and only if the hyperplane arrangement is '3-generated.'  This gives a starting point if the goal is to inductively construct free spline modules.

<b><font size="3"> Macaulay2 tutorials </b>
<br>
Each of the following scripts is a tutorial that can be uploaded to the Macaulay2 web interface.  To run the following files as intended, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li> Click to download the .m2 file to your computer, but switch the .m2 extension to .md (for instance, save "Quadrants_And_Octants.m2" as "Quadrants_And_Octants.md")
  <li> Open the Macaulay2 web interface at <a href="https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au/"> this link </a>.
  <li> In the left-hand panel,  click on the "Load your own tutorial" tab.
  <li> Upload the .md file that you just downloaded.
  <li> You should now see the uploaded file appear as a new tab on the left hand side.
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="Macaulay2 Demos/Quadrants_And_Octants.m2"> Quadrants_And_Octants.m2 </a>
  <li> <a href="Macaulay2 Demos/Hyperplanes_And_Zonotopes.m2"> Hyperplanes_And_Zonotopes.m2 </a>
</ul>

<b><font size="3"> Macaulay2 supplementary script </b>
<br>
The following script contains useful functions.  They can be run by downloading the file (keep the .m2 extension for this one!) and then uploading to the editor in the Macaulay2 web interface.
