--In this file we explore the twisted cubic, which is the image of the 
--map from R^1 to R^3 defined by the parametric equations
--x=t,y=t^2,z=t^3

--First, define the coordinate ring of affine three space (we'll work
--over the rational numbers since Macaulay2 doesn't work well yet
--over the real or complex numbers)
S=QQ[x,y,z]

--Next, define the coordinate ring of affine one dimensional space
T=QQ[t]

--The parametrization x=t,y=t^2,z=t^3 is realized by the map of coordinate rings
--phi from S to T defined by phi(x)=t, phi(y)=t^2, and phi(z)=t^3.
--We define this map as follows.
phi=map(T,S,{t,t^2,t^3})

--The image of the parametrization is an affine variety in three-dimensional space.
--This means that there are equations that define the image of this map.
--The following command computes the kernel of the ring homorphism phi; this is an
--ideal whose generators cut out the image 
I=ker phi
