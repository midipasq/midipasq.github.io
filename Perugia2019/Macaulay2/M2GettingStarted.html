 <b>Getting Started in Macaulay2</b>
<br>
We encourage everyone to set up a CoCalc account: please go to <a href="https://cocalc.com/">https://cocalc.com/</a> to set up an account.  Ideally, we can make five or six collaboration groups in CoCalc.  To use Macaulay2 in CoCalc follow these instructions:
<ul>
  <li> Create a project
  <li> Click the "New" button
  <li> Click "Linux Terminal"
  <li> Inside the linux terminal, type "M2" and press enter
</ul>
Alternatively, you can <a href="http://web.macaulay2.com/"> try Macaulay2 online! </a>.  This option appears to not work currently - if it starts working we will make a remark here.

Finally, if you wish to install Macaulay2 on your computer, go to <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/Downloads/"> https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/Downloads/ </a>.  Make sure to follow the instructions that match your operating system.  It will probably take several tries to get everything installed and working properly (especially on Windows!).  Be patient, and don't hesitate to ask for help!
